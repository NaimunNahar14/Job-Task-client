## Front-end Requirements:

* Homepage: The project's homepage serves as the central hub for task management. It displays tasks categorized by their status groups: "To Do," "Doing," and "Done," offering users an immediate overview of their workload.

* Add Task: The application features a user-friendly form to create new tasks. Users can input the task title and description, streamlining the task creation process.

* Edit Task: Users have the option to edit an existing task's title and description, ensuring they can adapt their tasks as needed.

* Delete Task: Task management includes the ability to permanently remove a task, allowing users to declutter their workspace.

* Task Status: One of the standout features of the Kanban Board is the ability to effortlessly drag and drop tasks between different status categories (e.g., "To Do," "Doing," and "Done"). This intuitive interface empowers users to update task progress with ease.

* Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. This responsiveness ensures users can manage their tasks from anywhere.

## Back-end Requirements:

* API Creation: The back-end component of the project involves creating a robust API with endpoints to support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.
